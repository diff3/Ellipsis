Ellipsis (indicating omission)
Typography - A mark consisting of three periods, colloquially known as 'dot-dot-dot'.

Ellipsis is an addon that features multi-target aura tracking for spells that you (and your pet) cast on others. Additionally it keeps track of your pets spells when cast on others, tracks ground-targeted AoEs, temporary minion summons and totems. Cooldowns for your items, pet abilities and your own abilities can also be tracked. Options can be accessed by typing either /ellipsis or /...

Terminology
Aura - HoTs, DoTs, Buffs & Debuffs cast by you or your pet
Unit - Yourself, your pet, party members or hostile mobs (basically anything you can hurl spells at)

Auras, Units & Unit Groups
All auras you cast are attached to the unit they are cast on and these are then seperated into one of 7 groups when displayed. The first 4 groups are based on what the unit is, the 5th is a special case (see The Non-Targeted Unit below), and the last 2 are overrides for your current target and focus to keep them seperate (if desired) from every other displayed unit. Each group can be assigned to any of the 7 available display frames, and multiple groups can be assigned to a single frame.

Example: Assign all harmful units to frame [1], and your target to frame [2] to quickly reference the DoT situation on your current target 'pulled out' from the mess of all your other DoTs.

The Non-Targeted Unit
Some auras exist without any unit to attach themselves to such as temporary minion summons, totems, and ground-targeted AoE spells. These are all grouped together under the special Non-Targeted unit, which is the sole member of the non-targeted group (and can be assigned to a display frame and sorted just like any other unit).

Installation
There are two 'mods' included with Ellipsis, the main mod itself (folder: Ellipsis) and the configuration options (folder: Ellipsis_Options). Only the first is required to use the mod, though you will not be able to change options without the latter; Ellipsis_Options is also Load on Demand and thus won't use up any resources until you begin changing options (which is also why its a seperate folder/addon).
